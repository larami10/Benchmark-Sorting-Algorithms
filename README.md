# Benchmark Sorting Algorithms

This program uses the creation of 3 different formats of arrays to hypothesize, test and Benchmark Sorting Algorithms.

1. halfZeros - Create, print, and return array with half of the elements being 0's and the other half being 1's.
2. halfRemainders - Creates, prints and returns array with half of the elements being 0's and increasing the values as number of elements are halved.
3. halfRandom - Creates, prints and returns array with half of the elements being 0's and the other half being random.
4. Randomize - shuffle, print, and returns array.
5. Log - Calculate b to find Big-OH.
6. toString - Print the array

> **_NOTE:_** Review the main function in NonUniform.java for printed implementation

## How to use the Project

You can clone the repository and execute the following commands from inside the src folder:

```
javac NonUniform.java InsertionSort.java SelectionSort.java ShellSort.java Stopwatch.java
```

Java class files will be created inside the src folder, then run:

```
java NonUniform
```
